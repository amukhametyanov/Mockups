      Curbside pickup orders take approximately 2 hours to fulfill. Once your
      order has been processed you will receive an email and a text message
      confirming that your "Order is Ready for Pickup". You will also receive
      subsequent reminder emails and text messages in case your order is not
      picked up. At pickup, please have a valid piece of government issued photo
      ID ready for verification. Government issued photo ID must match the name
      and address on the order. You will have 7 days to pickup your order before
      it is cancelled.
