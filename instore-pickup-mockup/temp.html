        In-Store Pickup orders take approximately 4 hours to fulfill. Once your order has been processed, you will receive an email and a text message confirming that your "Order is Ready for Pickup". You will also receive subsequent reminder emails and text messages in case your order is not picked up. When you arrive at the store to pick up your order once you have received the confirmation email, please head to the Customer Service/Cash Desk. Please have a valid piece of government issued photo ID ready for verification. Government issued photo ID must match the name and address on the order. Please note, you will have 7 days to pick up your order. On the 8th day your order will be cancelled.
