    Sporting Life offers a 60-day return policy for all online purchases. In order to qualify for a
    refund, please include your invoice in the parcel. All products must be unworn, unused, and in
    original condition. Returns will be processed back to the original method of payment.
    <ul>
        <li style="padding: 0 0 15px 25px;">If we receive your return after the 60-day time period, the return will be processed onto a
